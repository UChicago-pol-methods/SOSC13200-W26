# AI Use Policy for SOSC 13200

## Overview

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot can be valuable learning aids when used appropriately. This policy outlines when and how you may use AI assistance in this course.

## Guiding Principle

The goal of this course is for *you* to learn statistical reasoning and R programming. AI tools should support that learning, not replace it. If an AI writes your code or interprets your results, you haven't learned the skill—you've just produced an artifact.

## Permitted Uses

You may use AI tools for:

- **Debugging error messages**: "What does this error mean and how do I fix it?"
- **Syntax help**: "How do I change the axis labels in ggplot2?"
- **Explaining concepts**: "What is the difference between standard error and standard deviation?"
- **Understanding existing code**: Asking an AI to explain what a code chunk does
- **Data cleaning tasks**: Reshaping, merging, or reformatting datasets

## Not Permitted

You may NOT use AI tools for:

- **Writing analysis code for assignments**: You must write your own `lm()`, `ggplot()`, and other analysis code
- **Interpreting your results**: The written interpretations in your assignments and final project must be your own
- **Generating your final project report**: The analysis, interpretation, and writing must be your own work

## Disclosure Requirement

If you use AI assistance on any assignment, include a brief note at the end of your submission describing:
1. Which AI tool you used
2. What you used it for (e.g., "debugging a ggplot error," "understanding the subset() function")

Example:
```
AI Disclosure: I used Claude to help debug an error message when my
read.csv() command failed. It explained that my file path was incorrect.
```

No disclosure is needed if you did not use AI tools.

## Why This Policy?

Learning to program and do statistical analysis is like learning a language—you have to practice it yourself to become fluent. Watching someone else (or an AI) do it doesn't build the same skills.

The debugging and syntax help that AI tools provide is similar to asking a TA or classmate for help, which has always been permitted. But having an AI write your analysis defeats the purpose of the assignment.

## Academic Integrity

Using AI for prohibited purposes (writing your analysis code or interpretations) constitutes a violation of academic integrity and will be treated accordingly. When in doubt, ask.
